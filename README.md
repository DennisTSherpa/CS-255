# CS-255
An SNHU course towards obtaining an Associate Degree in Computer Science.

This repository is a summary of all the assignments I completed throughout the CS-255 course provided by SNHU.

I will answer some questions to provide you a better understanding:

Que 1} Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Ans-> Summary of the DriverPass project:

        i. Client: DriverPass
        
        ii. Type of system requested: A website that allowed them to provide the resources (i.e. online classes, tests and in-person driving lessons) to students (aka customers) hoping to pass their DMV test.
        
Que 2} What did you do particularly well?

Ans-> I exceled in providing accurate system designs that meet the client's requirements. Also, I succeeded in developing a plan to meet user requirementson in an organized and timely manner.

Que 3} If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Ans-> I would choose to revise my class diagram for DriverPass. I would improve it by adding more details (like functions of class) to depict a better structure layout of the DriverPass system.

Que 4} How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Ans-> I interpret user needs by asking key questions that will provide me the specific answers I need to understand their aspirations for their system design. Furthermore, by clearly understanding and organizing the user's needs I was able to efficiently implement them into my system design. It crucial to consider the user's needs when designing because the system is designed for the user, therefore, it must fulfill the user's expectations.

Que 5} How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Ans-> I approach designing software in the following order:

        1. Understand software requirements.
        2. Create a drafts of software designs.
        3. Repeat and refine.
            i. Get and implement feedback.
            ii. Learn and improve.
            iii. Check and correct.
        4. Create final software design.

      The techniques or strategies I would use in the future to analyze and design a system are:
      
        1. Effective reading and note-taking strategies.
        2. Asking specific questions to obtain definite and vital answers.
        3. Clear organization of system information.
        4. Constant improvement of system design by incorporating feedback and new knowledge.
        5. Utilizing diagrams to represent the system's different aspects.
        6. Utilizing Gantt charts to create a detailed schedule to complete succeesfully, orderly, and punctually.
        7. Journaling to reflect on the process to improve future system designs and analysis.
